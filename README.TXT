Dojo Widget Weaver
(created by Venkatesh Jagannathan)

This tool is used to generate the code commonly and repeadly written to create pages containing dojo widgets. This can be quickly accessed and used easily to generate code like dojo.connect, make xhr calls, publish/subscribe events and other common implementations.

Features: -

a) Both pre and post 1.7 version code generation
b) Easily configurable templates (json based)
c) Simple and quick interface

For now only tested on chrome, but since utilizes jQuery compatibility should not be a problem
More features being added incrementally.


Please feel free to share suggestions/issues.
